# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Define a VPC with CloudFormation template and deploy via bash script `build.sh`

# Default VPC
---------
All new AWS accounts come with a default VPC in each region. Pictured below is a default VPC in us-east-1. The default VPC in each region contains a subnet in every availability zone. The network access control list allows inbound and outbound traffic from all IPs (0.0.0.0/0), and the default route table enables communication between resources within and between subnets and forwards outbound traffic to the internet gateway.

This works fine for simple deployments but for most applications, you need more control over network security and application deployment configurations. That's a job for a custom VPC.


# Custom VPC
---------
Pictured below is a custom VPC that has both public and private subnets. A subnet is public if it accepts inbound traffic from the internet, and a subnet is private if it does not, or otherwise restricts inbound public traffic. A private subnet uses a NAT gateway to enable outbound traffic to the internet. To access resources within a private subnet, say an EC2 instance, you can use a bastion host or session manager.

# Deploying the VPC
---------
The VPC CloudFormation template given in this project `vpc.yml` defines a custom VPC with three public and three private subnets, an Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, NACL, RouteTables, Routes, and a Security Group that limits access to a known IP address. Feel free to customize as you see fit.

  * Install and configure AWS CLI
  * On Windows -- Install Git with Unix/Linux tools for access to bash shell
  * Edit `build.sh` and/or `vpc.yml` to customize deployment
  * You'll need to edit the SecurityGroupAllowedIP parameter and change the IP address to your IP address
  * Run `./build.sh` to get help
  * Run `./build.sh dev oh vpc` to deploy development VPC in us-east-2
